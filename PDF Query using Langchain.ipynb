This tax is\\ndeducted from the crediting rate that applies to your super, before the earnings are\\ncredited to your account.\\nTax on withdrawals:  Your super is made up of two components: taxable and tax-free.\\nThere’ s no tax payable on the tax-free component. Lump sum withdrawals are generally\\ntax-free if you’re aged 60 or over.

This cover provides a basic level of protection\\nif you die, or become ill or injured.\\nDeath cover  – can provide a lump sum to your beneficiaries if you die.\\nTotal & Permanent Disablement (TPD) cover – can provide a lump sum payment if you\\nbecome totally and permanently disabled and can no longer work.\\nIncome Protection  – can provide monthly payments to help you get by if you become\\nill or injured (at work or outside of work) and can’t work.\\nIf you have Death or TPD cover you’re also covered for terminal illness. A terminal illness\\npayment can help ease some of the financial stress if you’re suffering from a terminal\\nmedical condition.\\nAustralianSuper  insurance is provided by TAL Life Limited  (the Insurer)\\nABN 70 050 109 450  AFSL 237848 .\\nBasic Death, TPD and Income Protection cover\\nBasic cover is age-based. Your cover amount and cost change as you get older. Once\\nyou’re eligible for cover to start, you’ll pay for the cost of your cover. See page 14 for\\nbasic cover amounts and costs.\\nWhen your basic cover starts\\nYou automatically receive basic cover if you’re eligible. You’re eligible if you’re 25 or older;\\nand your super balance reaches $6,000; and you’ve received an employer super\\ncontribution after your super balance first reaches $6,000 (age limits and other conditions\\napply).\\nOnce you’re eligible, your basic cover will start on the latest of these dates:\\nthe date you turn 25 (as long as you’re receiving employer super contributions), or\\nthe date your balance first reaches $6,000, or\\nthe date you started working for your employer, or\\nthe start date of the payment period that applies to your first employer super contribution\\n(after your balance first reaches $6,000).\\nBasic cover can’t start any earlier than 120 days before we receive your first employer\\nsuper contribution (after your super balance first reaches $6,000).\\nYour first payment may be higher than your ongoing monthly payments. That's because\\nit includes insurance costs from the date your cover started to the date of your first\\npayment deduction from your super account (which may be for a period that ’s longer\\nthan a month).\\nThere are circumstances when your basic cover may start for a short period even though\\nyou’ve cancelled it. The cost for this cover will be deducted from your super account after\\nyour cover has been cancelled because costs are deducted one month in arrears.\\nInsurance costs are deducted monthly from your super account and they\\nreduce your retirement savings. If you don’t want your basic cover to start\\nautomatically when you become eligible, you can opt out by cancelling it\\n– even if it hasn’t started yet.\\nConsider the impact of insurance costs on your retirement savings when\\nyou review your insurance needs.

This duty also applies when extending or making changes to existing insurance, and reinstating insurance.\\nIf you do not meet your duty\\nIf you do not meet your legal duty, this can have serious impacts on your insurance. Under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) \\nthere are a number of different remedies that may be available to the Insurer. They are intended to put the Insurer in the position it would have been in if the duty had been met. For example, the Insurer may:\\n•\\n avoid the cover (treat it as if it never existed);\\n• vary the amount of the cover; or\\n• vary the terms of the cover.\\nWhether the Insurer can exercise one of these remedies depends on a number of factors, including:•\\n whether reasonable care was taken not to make a misrepresentation. This depends on all of the relevant circumstances;\\n• what the Insurer would have done if the duty had been met – for example, whether it would have offered cover, and if so, on  \\nwhat terms;\\n• whether the misrepresentation was fraudulent; and\\n• in some cases, how long it has been since the cover started.\\nBefore any of these remedies are exercised, the Insurer will explain the reasons for its decision, how to respond and provide \\nfurther information, and what you can do if you disagree.\\nGuidance for answering the questions in this form\\nYou are responsible for the information provided to the Insurer. When answering questions, please:\\n• Think carefully about each question before you answer. If you are unsure of the meaning of any question, please ask us \\nbefore you respond.\\n• Answer every question.\\n• Answer truthfully, accurately and completely. If you are unsure about whether you should include information, please include it.\\n• Review your application carefully before it is submitted. If someone else helped prepare your application (for example, your adviser), please check every answer (and if necessary, make any corrections) before the application is submitted.\\nPlease note that there may be circumstances where the Insurer later investigates whether the information given to it was true.  \\nFor example, it may do this when a claim is made.\\nChanges before your cover starts\\nBefore your cover starts, the Insurer may ask you whether the information that has been given as part of your application for \\ninsurance remains accurate or whether there has been a change to any of your circumstances. As any changes might require  \\nfurther assessment or investigation, it could save time if you let us or the Insurer know about any changes when they happen.\\nIf you need help\\nIt’s important that you understand your obligations and the questions that are being asked. Please contact us for help if you have difficulty understanding the process of obtaining insurance or answering any questions.\\nPlease also let us know if you’re having difficulty due to a disability, understanding English or for any other reason – we’re here \\nto help and can provide additional support.\\n4.2 Cancel your cover\\nComplete this section to cancel one or more cover types. You won't be insured for any cover you cancel from the date your cancellation is received by AustralianSuper or the Insurer (as applicable). This means for the type of cover you cancel:\\n•\\n Your basic cover won’t start when you become eligible. \\n• You (or your beneficiaries) won’t be able to make an insurance claim if you suffer an illness or injury or you die after the cancellation.\\n• The cost of cover won't be or will stop being deducted from your super account (costs are deducted one month in arrears).\\n• You might not be able to get cover later. That’s because you’ll need to apply for that cover in the future and provide detailed \\nhealth information for the Insurer to consider.\\nIf you’re replacing this cover with another insurance policy, you should wait until the other super fund or insurer confirms your\\n \\ncover has started before you cancel. You should consider getting financial advice to help work out if cancellation is right for you.\\nAs an AustralianSuper member, you also have access to a choice of help and advice options from simple, personal advice over the \\nphone, to more comprehensive, broader advice with a financial adviser1. Go to australiansuper.com/advice for more information.\\n1  Personal financial product advice is provided under the Australian Financial Services Licence held by a third party and not by AustralianSuper Pty Ltd.

If you're receiving employer super contributions, you can apply to start your \\nbasic cover, even if your super balance hasn't reached $6,000. You should read the Insurance in your super guide for important information about when your cover will start. \\nThe cost of your cover will be deducted monthly from your super account from the date your cover starts. \\nIf you don't want all of your basic cover to start, you can cancel part of your cover (section 4.2). If you've chosen to cancel \\nany cover, the type(s) of cover you've cancelled won't start automatically, even if your super balance reaches $6,000 in the future. If you want that cover type in the future, you'll need to apply and provide detailed health information for the Insurer to consider.\\n4.4 Start your basic cover later\\nThis is our default option. There's no action required if you’d like your basic cover to start later – once you're 25 or older and your super balance has reached $6,000; and you’ve received an employer super contribution after your super balance first reaches $6,000. If you’ve chosen to cancel any cover, the type(s) of cover you’ve cancelled won't start automatically, even if your super balance reaches $6,000 in the future.\\n4.5 Change your individual work rating\\nA work rating classifies the usual activities of your job into one of three ratings: Blue Collar, White Collar or Professional.
